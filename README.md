# AI-Based-HealthCare-Chatbot-System-Final-Year-Project-
I developed a web-based AI-powered healthcare assistant that helps users analyze their symptoms, get instant health insights, and connect with the right medical specialists. The system also enables patients to book doctor appointments online through an interactive chatbot interface. Built with Django (backend), LLaMA-3 API (AI engine), and Bootstrap (frontend) for a responsive and user-friendly design, the platform leverages Generative AI to deliver personalized health recommendations and enhance patient–doctor communication. This project aims to make healthcare more accessible, efficient, and intelligent through seamless web technology.
